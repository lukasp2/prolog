# prolog

How to run the prolog program:
run prolog.
change the working directory by entering into the Prolog console window:
working_directory(_, 'C:/path/to/files') .

now consult the files by executing these commands:
['variables.pl']
['functions.pl']
['main.pl']

the program can now be started by typing "start ." into the Prolog console.

note that every prolog command needs to be ended with a dot.
